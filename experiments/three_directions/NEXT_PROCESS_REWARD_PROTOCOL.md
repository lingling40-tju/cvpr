# Next group-four representation-to-reward experiment

Status: design and stage gates only. No representation checkpoint, new
training run, or navigation gain is claimed here. The mode-stratified
ordinal pilot failed its matched 256-episode screen (SR -5.47, SPL -5.23
percentage points) and did not enter the 128-step scale suite.

## Question and algorithm

Test whether a policy-grounded *history* representation can provide a
calibrated movement-progress signal without encouraging premature STOP.
Previous frozen terminal scores have plausible train-scene pair ranks but
all four tested reward variants reduced matched val-unseen navigation.
The new representation must therefore pass a separate STOP and
instruction-grounding gate before its score enters RL.

Use the navigation SFT model's original multi-turn observation and action
format, not a single-image surrogate prompt. Adapt its visual-language
states with a small trainable module (and, if the small module fails, one
predeclared LoRA variant), producing two distinct outputs:

- `progress(I, history_t)`: instruction-conditioned progress from the
  trajectory start, trained by ordinal and local-distance comparisons on
  *R2R train* trajectories. Simulator geodesic distances may construct
  train labels, but must not be model inputs or validation reward inputs.
- `stop_ready(I, history_t)`: probability that STOP at this observation
  satisfies the task success radius. Train positive/negative views from
  train-scene expert paths and policy rollouts, including hard negatives
  from the same scene and near-goal but wrong-instruction pairs. This head
  is an audit/gate at first; do not turn it into a STOP bonus merely
  because its train loss is low.

The representation uses a scene-disjoint fit/development/audit split
within R2R train. Freeze episode IDs, scene IDs, feature hashes, and the
labeling rule before fitting. In addition to local progress accuracy,
measure same-start/different-goal instruction preference and STOP
calibration on the untouched audit scenes. Record positives, negatives,
scene counts, confidence intervals, and threshold selection on
development scenes. A candidate may enter RL only if the audit has at
least 100 local progress pairs and 100 STOP positives plus 100 STOP
negatives, and reaches all of: >=75% progress-pair accuracy, >=75%
instruction-swap accuracy, STOP AUROC >=0.80, and <=10% false STOP rate
at a development-selected threshold with >=50% recall. These are
go/no-go screens, not expected performance claims. A failed screen ends
this candidate without another GPU-heavy policy run.

For a passing representation, the *initial* RL reward uses bounded
progress differences only on movement/turn actions. Use signed
`clip(progress_t - progress_(t-1), -c, c)` and a confidence gate;
do not reward STOP from `stop_ready` in the first pilot. Preserve the
original outcome advantage in groups containing a success. In a
four-rollout all-failure group, compute per-turn returns-to-go from the
process signal, center them against the other active rollouts from that
same episode, and map each turn's advantage only to its own action
tokens. Mask observation tokens and the final STOP action from the
auxiliary term. This differs from the current verl implementation, which
sums token rewards and broadcasts one scalar advantage to all action
tokens. First prove with a synthetic example that equal terminal totals
at different turns yield different action-token advantages; then run a
two-step smoke test checking four rollouts per group, reward/turn masks,
nonzero actor gradients, and no accidental STOP bonus. Do not describe
this as policy-invariant shaping.

Step-aware VLN reward and process alignment are already studied by
SACA (Li et al., arXiv:2603.09740) and semantic progress by
Progress-Think (Wang et al., arXiv:2511.17097). Any later paper claim
must compare with these methods; the proposed distinction here is the
separate STOP calibration gate and explicit verification of turn-wise
credit assignment in this ActiveVLN implementation.

## Four-A800 schedule and validation budget

1. **Data/representation preflight.** Reuse cached train-only policy
   rollouts and expert frames. Collect only missing history or hard
   negative views. Cache each frozen visual state once; run scene split,
   labeling, calibration, and audit before RL. GPU 0 may render Habitat
   views, GPU 1 may fit the representation, and GPUs 2/3 can perform
   independent feature extraction or a frozen-control check. Report
   GPU-hours and cache hits. Do not fill all GPUs with duplicate work.
2. **Training wiring.** Keep `rollout.n=4`, batch size 4, 16 rollouts per
   optimizer step, seed 11, the same SFT initializer and 256 train rows
   as the cached group-four outcome-only control. During policy training,
   the validated layout is GPU 0 for 16 Habitat instances, GPU 1 for the
   reward service, GPUs 2/3 for policy rollout and updates. Train two
   steps first, then at most 64 if all audits pass. Sequential candidate
   training is necessary when the four-card layout is saturated.
3. **Paired unseen screen.** Freeze a fourth disjoint 256-episode
   val-unseen manifest before looking at its outcomes. Evaluate the
   candidate and same-seed, same-group-size, same-step control on the
   *same* episode IDs. Run two lanes concurrently: each has one A800
   inference server and one A800 with four Habitat shards. Assert 256
   unique episodes per arm, no inference errors, and compute paired SR,
   SPL, discordant successes, and scene-bootstrap intervals. Repeated
   pilot selection on val-unseen is exploratory; do not claim a robust
   gain from this screen alone.
4. **Scale gate.** Only paired SR > 0 and paired SPL > 0 with valid
   coverage trigger 128-step training at seeds 11/22/33, all group 4,
   followed by paired complete 1,839-episode val-unseen evaluation.
   Existing full-eval control results can be reused only for exactly
   matching seed, training data, group size, and checkpoint step.
   If the group-four method genuinely improves full validation, an
   optional small group-eight check may use batch size 2 (still 16
   rollouts per step) and its **own** group-eight outcome control. It
   cannot replace the standard group-four comparison because episode
   diversity per step changes.

The blind semantic-verifier audit remains a single-AI annotation audit;
it is not independent human truth and is not used as a success label for
this experiment.
